# vue-util-components
Another collection of Vue Utility Components, css based on Tailwind CSS.

## General Information
Comes as it goes.

There are several directives within this package, see `/src/components/index.js` for more specific names.

## Docs
To preview the intended design simply open the `index.html` file in the repository root (`/`).

No changes will be made to Tailwind CSS' defaults even though the `tailwind.js` got added - otherwise it'll be stated here.

## Install
- `npm i [name to be found] --save-dev`
- `import { directive } from '[name to be found]';`
